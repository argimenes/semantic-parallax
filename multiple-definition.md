# Semantic Parallax

In the spirit of I. A. Richards, who believed that the best way to get at the true meaning of words and the concepts they (appear to) signal,
this will be a collection of words and their specific senses. 

For brevity I'll use the word "entry" to denote "word sense" in this collection.

So if an entry is not an authoritative dictionary definition, then what is it? An entry is simply whatever meaning I happen to have in mind when using that word in
a specific context. The purpose is to help eliminate ambiguities in communication. For example, if I made the controversial statement that "Art perished around halfway
through the 20th century", we are not in much confusion about what "20th century" refers to but are likely to be in considerable disagreement about what "art" might mean.
This collection is not meant to _prove_ any claims to the meaning of art, for example, one way or the other - simply to document as clearly as possible the referent 
(or references) the writer had in mind when they _used_ the word "art". Now, many entries are often likely to be contentious, inconsistent, poorly argued, etc. - but 
the aim here isn't really _proof_ but documentation. If an entry proves to be unclear another entry can be appended to the list which references this former entry and 
responds to it. The exact notation for this hasn't been finalised, yet, but this document is for human beings and not machine interpreters, so some leeway for 
refining a notation seems reasonable.

Entries can refer to each other and of course can (and probably will) refer to external sources, broadly or specifically. An entry doesn't have to constitute your 
particular "definition" of a word - remember, it is simply a pointer to a referent. Let's say you have in mind Coleridge's notion of the "Imagination", you need 
only note that in the entry. It doesn't have to be something you personally believe in - the idea is to simply document references. For example, in a statement 
like the following we can track the different senses intended for the word "imagination" by adding the relative index number after the word in square brackets.

> The general idea of how imagination[1] works in poetry is quite different from how Coleridge conceived of imagination[2] as a kind of agent of 
perception that alters our objective perception of reality.

My aim in compiling a collection of these multiple definitions is twofold:

1. As stated above, to help reduce ambiguity in my communications - in public and to myself, in my own writing - by documenting the precise word-meaning intended
2. To attempt to create a kind of "parallax view" of a word in its many senses, senses that extend beyond the formal dictionaries, and that functions like the ideal of "multiple definition" that I. A. Richards had in mind as a tool for thinking through some of the most treacherous problems in discourse. He wasn't concerned only with academic discourse - in fact he was far more concerned about loose language in public life and the potential for devastating misunderstandings.

Therefore, my hope is that in documenting these meanings I can both [a] help myself think more clearly by keeping in focus the specific sense of a word I had in mind, 
to try to not lose track of and twist this meaning through the labyrinth of argumentation, and [b] help others at least see what I was pointing to, no matter what word 
I happened to use and what assumptions are stuck to that word in their own minds.

I hope that others add to this document themselves.

## Conventions
Each sense will be given an incrementing index that starts at "1" (one) for each word and further
senses are simply appended to the list.  It's recommended that the author of the entry is included in case this document becomes collaborative. GitHub versioning 
will be the ultimate source of truth but it's time consuming to use it when you just want to quickly establish who wrote the entry.
